##Welcome to the unofficial EDA Phase 0 Basic Trainer. 

### Please read this file to understand what is going on, it will save you getting stuck later on down the track!

Purpose: The purpose of this trainer is to get new students used to using the command line interface in mac OSX and Linux based operating systems.
Anyone can download this and use it, it is really basic, that's the point.

The program is run totally in a 'sand-box' so you can't break anything on your computer using it! It's just IRB.

The first lesson takes you through the most common CLI (command line interface) commands that a junior developer will use.
It tells you what each one does, gives you an example, then asks the user to complete the command. 
  If successful it will notify you of what WOULD have happened in a real situation.
  If unsuccessful it will notify the student of what the command SHOULD have been. Easy huh?
  
Pull requests will be monitored once a week, depending on how much coffee I have had that day. Good luck.
